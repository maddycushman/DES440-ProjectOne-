          <p> The iconic horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick ended up being a horror on and off the screen. The movie is about supernatural forces putting pressure on an already fractured family. There was claustrophobia and agoraphobia on and off the screen as Kubrick made the cast feel just as crazy as the characters they were playing. If fact, it was so strenuous,
              Shelley Duvall became physically ill from the stress of shooting.  </p>
